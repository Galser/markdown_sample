# Main markdown sample file

This is the main fiule where I am going to ad in several commit my samples

## List of features (level 2 header) 

**Markdown syntax** allows us to : 

1. Format text
2. Create lists
3. Insert images
4. Create Headers and Quotes
5. Use basic syntax highlight for code
6. And some fancy extras (like tasks, emoji and so on), even in Pull Requests

### Format text (level 3 header, can be up to 6 levels)
We can apply **bold** as we use already did above or *italic* to some parts
We can have a special link formatting, for example [this markdown explanation from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 
or [this Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Note, headers can be created with alternative syntax 
----------------------------------------------------

Headers can be actually created with alternative syntax that slighlty reminds widely used in Python community RST format. 
For header 1 you create underlin with "=" symbol, for level 2 with symblo "-" like I did for this paragraph header. 

> We also can make blockquoptes, like this one

# Creating lists

We can have numbered lists :
1. One
2. Two
3. Many

Or we can have bulleted lists, for example with most popular Dutch fish species : 
* cod
* makrel AKA `Scrumbria Scumbriade` -> note here back-ticks used to make inline code highlight
* eurpoeean eel or officialy - `Anguilla anguilla`

And they can be nested also, iterating ove differnt formats : 
- We start with dash
- And then , if we have soimethign to nest
  * we putting two sapcves and star or dash
  * and - profit, we have list in list

# Insert images

Pretty straight forward. we can embed images, for example, above metnioned European eel :
